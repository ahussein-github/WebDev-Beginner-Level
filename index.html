          How can I start learning web development? Is it easy? And how can I
          keep up with the latest web designing technologies? These are the
          questions that appear in every beginner’s mind. There is also a
          confusion between web designing and web development, but we’ll talk
          about web development.

          How can I start to learn Web Development ?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <ins><strong>Stage 1 – HTML:</strong></ins> <br />
          HTML, you have heard about it lots of times before. If I am not wrong
          HTML is the language you have learned in your school life. Yes, it’s
          actually the same as what you have learned a long time ago but as long
          as time changes technologies are changes. Nowadays as you have grown
          up, even HTML has been grown up too, now there is called HTML5 which
          comes in existence. What? Worried about what is it? Don’t be. I just
          said that as we have grown up HTML has grown up too but the difference
          between us and HTML is, it changed its name to HTML5. In HTML5, you
          can not just prepare the basic structure of the web page but we have
          many more things that we can do. We can store and process values on
          variables on-page itself without any databases like we do in any
          programming languages (Temporary variables), we can develop games on
          it. No need for flash to play animations on it. Even we can develop a
          fully functional blog with HTML4 itself without any help to
          server-side scripting languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ins><strong>Stage 2 – CSS:</strong></ins> <br />
          We live in such a society where everybody wants to look pretty,
          beautiful, to achieve this everyone does makeup. Similarly, CSS does
          for HTML. CSS creates the beauty on HTML pages. With the help of CSS,
          you can make your web page colorful and smooth. You can even create
          animations using CSS. You can add transitions, changing the scrolling
          events of your pages, mouse click events and many more. But as HTML
          changes to HTML5, CSS also has been changed to CSS3.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ins><strong>Stage 3 – JAVASCRIPT:</strong></ins> <br />
          You have learned how your site will look like, you have designed the
          beauty of your page yet. Now, it’s turn to create some useful tasks
          that your web page elements will do when some activities performed on
          your web pages like button click events, mouse over any text, playing
          and pausing some animations on page, etc. With the help of JAVASCRIPT,
          you can do that easily. One of the best scripting languages used to
          make a web page more smooth, flexible and platform-independent is
          javascript. It’s not that easy to learn but whatever you learned at an
          easy level, that will be enough to do your all tasks.
